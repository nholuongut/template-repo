### Customize Repo in 1 Command

Run this script to replace the repo name and workflow URL references across the configurations for CI/CD and
other variety of files in this repo:

```shell
./customize.sh <new_repo_name>

Then delete the script and edit this README.

#### Ensure to update Codacy Grade link manually after adding this repo to Codacy since the link is a hash and therefore cannot be predicted for replacement by `./customize.sh`.
